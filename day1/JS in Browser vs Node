In Browser we have access to browser and webpage objects like Window and Document(DOM) and storage like cookies etc. whereas in Node you can access system files etc.
As JS is run in our own environment we can control the version and plugins of JavaScript rinning in node whereas in browser it depends on the client browser and config.
In Node you can interact with other services on the system(like Databases etc) whereas that is not permitted in browser mode.
In Node we use require instead of import in browser to include modules.
All Code must be in modules in Node not neccessarily in browsers
