#1-The development of front end should be such that it should take into consideration all knid of errors that might expectedly or unexpectly occur
If something can go wrong it will. Any property can come up as null or undefined so consider that.

#2-Always log errors to your server to investigate and track
#3- There is a window.onerror callback where all errors float to before coming to the user

#4-Types of errors
1.Type coercion i.e errors while typecasting leading to unexpected outcomes
2.Data type i.e wring operation on wrong datatypes or objects
3.Communication errors i.e invalid URL, bad connection, bad response etc.

#5-you can throw your own error to be handelled by catch blocks in outside scope so our code always know what exactly hapenned and how to handle it

#6-Fatal errors lead to total/major user inoperability vs non-fatal ones

#7-Log errors to browser log as well and add debugger so u can check for it as a client as well
