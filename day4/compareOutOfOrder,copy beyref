We can compare out of order objects by deep comparing i.e comparing each and every key, value pair
e.g
var obj1 = {"name":"GUVI","class":"FS"};
var obj2 = {"class":"FS","name":"GUVI"};
function compare(obj1,obj2){for(i in obj1){if(obj1[i]!=obj2[i]){return false;}}return true;}

Why objects are copied by reference----
Objects in most programming languages are by default copied by reference until and unless explicitly mentioned
The reason for that is copyying by value means all the properties will be copied
This might have far reaching consequences in terms of performace of the program
So to ensure that developers are consious about it, it is explicitly required to be programmed.
